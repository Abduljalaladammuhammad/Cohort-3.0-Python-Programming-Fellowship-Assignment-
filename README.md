My Journey into Arewa Data Science Academy

I started on a transformative journey with Arewa Data Science Academy, thanks to a friend who recognized my eagerness to acquire tech skills, particularly in machine learning. He shared a link to the academy on WhatsApp, and I promptly filled out the necessary information.

Months later, I received an email congratulating me on being selected for the Python Class Cohort 3.0 session, a prerequisite for the Machine Learning class. I was happy to begin my learning journey.

However, my enthusiasm was soon met with challenges. During the first meeting, network issues hindered my participation, and I missed vital information. Thanks to the Arewa Data Science Academy for providing session recordings, ensuring I didn’t fall behind.

Installation hurdles followed. While installing VS Code and WSL were easy, Miniconda and GitHub posed significant challenges. I learned valuable lessons:

Some apps may not install on your system; explore alternatives.
Perseverance and troubleshooting are essential.

To overcome installation obstacles:

I replaced Miniconda with Anaconda, its larger version.
I used Git instead of GitHub, which wasn’t compatible with my system.
